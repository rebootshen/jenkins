Hi Sachin,

 

I have been worked at HSBC for 1 month.

During this month, I meet a lots good people, HK team, UK
team, India team, Guangzhou team and Xi`an team, and familiar with my job now.

As DevOps Lead, I lead a team to push DevOps transformation
for DTC NewUI project.

Mostly Communication and Collaboration , sometimes coding by
hands myself.

 

Progress achieved:

Integrated jenkins with github,integrated jira with github,

Pushed tasks of housekeeping on github branches,
houreskeeping on teamsite folders,

Monitoring server healthy status with AppDynamics 

Increased jenkins server from only 1 to 5 now.

 

Not only maked improvement on tools chain, also I tried to
improve deployment workflow, automation testing workflow, scrum workflow.

please check following link for more details:

Currently I focus on automation testing , guide another qa
FT team at Xi`an to do health checking/ sanity testing / smoke testing /
regression testing, 

and integrate with our DevOps pipeline.

 

In the future, I will work with global automation testing
team, let more teams benefit from dtc-UI-Automation .

Next I will try to setup virtue service server
LISA(DevTest), to save team time from unstable server environment, and use
AppDynamics to investigate issues our team face.

I believe when I understand front end architecture, back end
architecture more and more , I will bring more values to HSBC and our company.

 

Regards,

Sam
